# Changelog

### v0.16

- Improved `fs.write` method, is an alias for `add` now (because `add` overwrites by default)
- Improved file system loading and saving


### v0.14.2

- Improved DNSLink lookup error handling
- Reduced time-to-save for the file system to 3 seconds instead of 5
- Removed unnecessary `console.log` calls
- Updated default `js-ipfs` to `v0.48.1` (was `v0.48.0`)

### v0.14.1

Removed the default import from the index file. Now you use the SDK as follows, browser stays the same.

```js
import * as sdk from 'fission-sdk'
import { initialise } from 'fission-sdk'

sdk.initialise()
initialise()
```


### v0.14.0

- Renamed `isAuthenticated` to `initialise`
- `initialise` will return an instance of the file system (can be disabled in case you use web workers)
- Adds `loadFileSystem` to load a file system (called automatically from `initialise` unless disabled). This function is responsible for caching the file system locally and making a file system if the user hasn't got one yet.
- Adds the `fs.appPath.private` and `fs.appPath.public` function to build paths.
- Adds the `fs.exists`, `fs.read` and `fs.write` file system methods
